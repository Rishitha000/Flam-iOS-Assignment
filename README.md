# Flam iOS Assignment â€“ Rishitha Garikapati

## Submitted Projects

###  Music Player Service
- Console-based Swift simulation using MVVM
- Features: Play, Pause, Skip
- Two sources: Local and Spotify (mocked)
- Demonstrates: Protocols, Singleton, State handling

###  Social Feed (Twitter-style)
- Console-based MVVM Swift project
- Simulates loading posts from a mock feed
- Implements ViewModel and mock service layer

##  Tech Used
- Language: Swift
- Architecture: MVVM
- Tools: Replit (console-based execution on Windows)

## Note
As I was working on a Windows system, I implemented the assignment in pure Swift using Replit. The projects simulate core app behavior and demonstrate design patterns and architecture without a UI.

Each folder contains:
- `main.swift`: Core logic
- `README.md`: Project-specific details
